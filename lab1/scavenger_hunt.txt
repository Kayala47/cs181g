1. Instance is the 'package' you're using, PhysicalDevice would be the hardware it runs on,
 and they work together to create a Device object which you can run commands on.

2. It puts all available devices into a list, then filters out those that don't support 
functionality we need, then sorts based on a custom ranking from DiscreteGPU to CPU.

3. With a filter, you might not get any values. It returns an Optional value, and we call unwrap 
to get the actual value.

4. A Device represents a channel of communication with hardware, but is not hardware. You can use 
Device to call functions and write to the screen.

5. Queues are sets of instructions that go to the GPU. Instructions of the same type go in the 
same queue_family because we want to only pass in one type at a time

6. Swapchains solve the issue of CPU providing image at same time as GPU is displaying (tearing). 
Swapchain is mechanism for swapping out series of images

7. Vertex just seems to be two numbers, so probably x,y coordinates

8. It creates a buffer starting on line 221, and that's just three vertices put together. From what I 
understand, it then is passed into a command buffer, which can be passed to the GPU to perform the drawing.
